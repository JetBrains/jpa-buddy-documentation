To make it more convenient for you, we decided not to choose any third-party platform to register subscriptions. The purchase process is entirely managed by JetBrains Marketplace, including payment processing, invoicing, and licensing. To get any license, please visit [this page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15075-jpa-buddy/pricing).

## Trial Subscription

For new users who haven't tried all the features of JPA Buddy yet, and for those who want to get one month for free, there is a 30-day trial period. You can see how to get it in the following video:

## Purchase Process

For those who have already used the trial period and want to continue using JPA Buddy paid features, two types of subscriptions are available: monthly and annual. To pay for a subscription JetBrains Marketplace provides two possible options:

- Pay via Credit Card
- Pay via PayPal

We will show you in the following video how to buy a subscription via a credit card. All the steps to get and activate a subscription will remain the same if you decide to pay via PayPal.

## Educational And Discounted Licenses

All features of JPA Buddy remain free for academic use (teachers, students, classroom assistance) as well as training courses, coding schools and bootcamps. To get it, you need to confirm the special status of your JetBrains account. To do this, scroll through the [Pricing page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15075-jpa-buddy/pricing) and follow the "Learn more..." link.
