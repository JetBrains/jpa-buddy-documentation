### DTO Generator & Coding Assistance

* We supported ModelMapper for code scaffolding, on-the-fly injection, and mapping methods generation <a href="https://issues.jpa-buddy.com/issue/JPAB-2069" target="_blank">JPAB-2069</a>
* Now, JPA Buddy knows how to use the `@Value` annotation from Lombok. Generate immutable DTOs and benefit from concise code <a href="https://issues.jpa-buddy.com/issue/JPAB-2352" target="_blank">JPAB-2352</a>
* Simplify your JSON serialization process by adding the `JsonIgnoreProperties(ignoreUnknown = true)` annotation from Jackson for your DTOs, ensuring effortless compatibility and smoother data handling <a href="https://issues.jpa-buddy.com/issue/JPAB-1218" target="_blank">JPAB-1218</a>
* Kotlin's lovers can now rejoice as we added full Kotlin support for DTO synchronization features <a href="https://issues.jpa-buddy.com/issue/JPAB-2099" target="_blank">JPAB-2099</a>

### Reverse Engineering

* Defining a parent entity during Reverse Engineering is now possible, enabling you to build your entity hierarchy and maintain a well-organized project structure <a href="https://issues.jpa-buddy.com/issue/JPAB-1950" target="_blank">JPAB-1950</a>
* Now, JPA Buddy can migrate database comments using the @Comment annotation from Hibernate or Java Doc <a href="https://issues.jpa-buddy.com/issue/JPAB-1268" target="_blank">JPAB-1268</a>

This improvement has significantly enhanced the performance of the "JPA Entities from Database" action. Additionally, this allows JPA Buddy to use all the connection settings specified within the IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate interface <a href="https://issues.jpa-buddy.com/issue/JPAB-1296" target="_blank">JPAB-1296</a>

### Entity Designer

* The "Extract to MappedSuperclass" feature has become even better! Now, you can extract both attributes and methods into a MappedSuperclass <a href="https://issues.jpa-buddy.com/issue/JPAB-1692" target="_blank">JPAB-1692</a>
* You can now apply `@SuperBuilder` annotation from Lombok by using JPA Inspector <a href="https://issues.jpa-buddy.com/issue/JPAB-2480" target="_blank">JPAB-2480</a>

### Non-JPA Support

* We expanded our support by adding the ability to include attributes from non-JPA domain entities into your DTOs <a href="https://issues.jpa-buddy.com/issue/JPAB-2338" target="_blank">JPAB-2338</a>
* Also, we enhanced the navigation capabilities, you can now navigate from a DTO to a non-JPA domain entity with ease <a href="https://issues.jpa-buddy.com/issue/JPAB-2337" target="_blank">JPAB-2337</a>
* Generating MapStruct interfaces for non-JPA domain entities is also possible now <a href="https://issues.jpa-buddy.com/issue/JPAB-2372" target="_blank">JPAB-2372</a>

Last but not least, starting from this release, JPA Buddy analyzes not only the entire project for the presence of specific dependencies but also each individual module (in the case of a multi-module project). So, <a href="https://jpa-buddy.com/documentation/#dependencies" target="_blank">certain features</a> will be activated depending on the required dependencies in a module.

We're continuously working to improve your experience with JPA Buddy, and this release is no exception.
