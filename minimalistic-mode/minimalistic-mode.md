The minimalistic mode is designed to minimize distraction for developers. If you are the one who prefers to have everything at your fingertips – you will like it! All JPA Buddy panels will be hidden and its content will be available in standard IntelliJ IDEA windows, such as Project panel, Generate Menu and so on... 

## Enabling Minimalistic Mode 

There are three ways to activate the minimalistic mode. 

### Via Main Menu 

To enable or disable minimalistic mode, open "View" in the Toolbar window and click on the toggle button "JPA Buddy Minimalistic Mode". Note that all panels will be removed from the sides. You need to click the same button again to bring them back.

Another way to activate minimalistic mode is to click on the "JPA Buddy Minimalistic Mode" button in the JPA Structure.

## Using Features in the Minimalistic View 

### JPA Structure 

Since one of the primary purposes of [JPA Structure](https://www.jpa-buddy.com/documentation/entity-designer/#jpa-structure) panel is to provide a comprehensive data-centric view of the project, it will be available in the Project panel. You can select it from the drop-down list.
