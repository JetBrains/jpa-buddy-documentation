## What is JPA Buddy?

JPA Buddy is a plugin for IntelliJ IDEA that makes working with JPA and related technologies easier. It provides development tools for Hibernate, EclipseLink, Spring Data JPA, Liquibase, Flyway, SQL, and similar things.

JPA Buddy makes the development process easier by:

- introducing rich code generation capabilities

  - [Data model](https://www.jpa-buddy.com/documentation/entity-designer/)
  - [Spring Data](https://www.jpa-buddy.com/documentation/spring-data/) interfaces
  - [DB migrations](https://www.jpa-buddy.com/documentation/database-versioning/) (Liquibase, Flyway)
  - [Reverse engineering](https://www.jpa-buddy.com/documentation/reverse-engineering/)
- integrating smart inspections
- providing better navigation via a data-centric view of the project
- offering comprehensive coding assistance capabilities

## Installation and Project Setup

JPA Buddy is compatible with both IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition and IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate Edition. It is available on the [JetBrains marketplace](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15075-jpa-buddy), where it can be downloaded and installed.

The purchase process is entirely managed by JetBrains Marketplace, including payment processing, invoicing, and licensing. To get a license, please visit [this page](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15075-jpa-buddy/pricing).

- [Pay via PayPal](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15075-jpa-buddy/pricing)

In the following video, we will show you how to buy a subscription via a credit card. All the steps to get and activate a subscription will remain the same if you decide to use PayPal.

### The Difference Between an Individual and Company Licenses

The [**Personal license**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15075-jpa-buddy/pricing#edition=personal) is an option for private individuals who purchase a license with their own funds and solely for their own use. This license can be used for both individual and commercial projects. Personal licenses are not to be purchased, refunded or in any way financed by companies.

The [**Company license**](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15075-jpa-buddy/pricing#edition=commercial) is the standard licensing option for organizations and businesses. Licenses are purchased by the company and can be used by any single person within this organization. So if anyone quits the job, the company can assign this license to another employee. More than one employee should not use the same license simultaneously.

The following table should help with choosing the most appropriate licensing schema for you:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Individual License</th>
    <th>Company License</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Who pays for the license?</td>
    <td>Developer with their own funds</td>
    <td>Company</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Who manages?</td>
    <td>Developer</td>
    <td>Company. The license can be reassigned between individuals.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can be used by more than one developer?</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can be used to develop commercial software?</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can be used for development in a company?</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What if a developer leaves a company?</td>
    <td>The license leaves with them</td>
    <td>The license stays within company and can be assigned to another developer</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Verifying Installation

To make sure that the plugin is installed correctly, follow these steps:

- Open Plugin Settings IntelliJ IDEA window: clicks File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Installed. Make sure that JPA Buddy there is in this section and enabled.

![settings_plugin_installed](img/settings_plugin_installed.jpeg)

- Open existing or create a new entity and click somewhere in it. You should find Editor Toolbar (1) and JPA Buddy tool window (2). Note that visual tools will appear only after JPA Buddy detects one of the dependencies described in the section above.

![first-sight](img/first-sight.png)

## Installing a Specific Version of JPA Buddy

Every version of JPA Buddy supports a range of IntelliJ IDEA versions. For example, JPA Buddy 4.3 works correctly with IntelliJ IDEA from 2021.1 to 2021.1.3. But if you have to install JPA Buddy on the other version of IntelliJ IDEA, you can do the following:

- Open JPA Buddy JetBrains Marketplace [page.](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15075-jpa-buddy)
- Open Versions tab.
- Find a version of JPA Buddy which satisfies the version of your IntelliJ IDEA and click on it.

![marketplace](img/marketplace.jpeg)

- In the opened window, click on the “Download” button.

![marketplace_description](img/marketplace_description.jpeg)

- Save .zip file to your PC.
- Now you have two options:

  - Open File -> Settings -> Plugins page click on the settings icon next to the “installed” tab and choose “install plugin from disc”. Find the downloaded .zip file, select it, and click “ok”.

  ![install_from_disk](img/install_from_disk.jpeg)

  - Simply drag and drop the .zip file to any IntelliJ IDEA window.
- To apply changes, click on the “Restart IDE” button
