### The Difference Between an Individual and Company Licenses

The **<a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15075-jpa-buddy/pricing#edition=personal" target="_blank">Personal license</a>** is available for individuals who purchase it with their own funds for their own use, it can be used for both personal and commercial projects. Personal licences are not intended to be purchased, refunded, or financed by companies.
The **<a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15075-jpa-buddy/pricing#edition=commercial" target="_blank">Company license</a>** is the standard licensing option for organizations and businesses. Licenses are purchased by the company and can be used by any single person within this organization. If an employee leaves the company, the license can be reassigned to another employee. However, this license can not be used by multiple employees simultaneously.

The following table should help with choosing the most appropriate licensing schema for you:

<table>
<thead>
  <tr>
    <th></th>
    <th>Individual License</th>
    <th>Company License</th>
  </tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
  <tr>
    <td>Who pays for the license?</td>
    <td>Developer with their own funds</td>
    <td>Company</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Who manages?</td>
    <td>Developer</td>
    <td>Company. The license can be reassigned between individuals.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can be used by more than one developer?</td>
    <td>No</td>
    <td>No</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can be used to develop commercial software?</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Can be used for development in a company?</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
    <td>Yes</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What if a developer leaves the company?</td>
    <td>The license leaves with them</td>
    <td>The license remains with the company and can be reassigned to another developer</td>
  </tr>
</tbody>
</table>

## Dependencies

Since JPA Buddy supports Hibernate, EclipseLink, SpringData, MapStruct, Liquibase and Flyway, it scans the project dependencies and enables the corresponding features. If you have a multi-module project, JPA Buddy features will be enabled depending on the presence of the dependency within the module, rather than the entire project.

## Verifying Installation

To make sure that the plugin is installed correctly, follow these steps:

1. Open Plugin Settings IntelliJ IDEA window: clicks File -> Settings -> Plugins -> Installed. Make sure that JPA Buddy there is in this section and enabled.
    ![settings-plugin-installed](img/settings-plugin-installed.jpeg)
2. Open existing or create a new entity and click somewhere in it. You should find Editor Toolbar (1) and JPA Buddy tool window (2). Note that visual tools will appear only after JPA Buddy detects one of the dependencies described in the section above.

    ![first-sight](img/first-sight.png)

## Installing a Specific Version of JPA Buddy

<a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15075-jpa-buddy/versions" target="_blank">Every version of JPA Buddy</a> supports a range of IntelliJ IDEA versions. For example, JPA Buddy 2023.1 works correctly with IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2, 2022.3 and 2023.1. But if you have to install JPA Buddy on the other version of IntelliJ IDEA, you can do the following:

* Open <a href="https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/15075-jpa-buddy" target="_blank">JPA Buddy JetBrains Marketplace page</a>.
* Open Versions tab.
* Find a version of JPA Buddy which satisfies the version of your IntelliJ IDEA and click on it.

![marketplace](img/marketplace.jpeg)

- In the opened window, click on the "Download" button.

![marketplace-description](img/marketplace-description.jpeg)
